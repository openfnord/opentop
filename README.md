# opentop
open top is some sort of container.
There are open top containers in shipping to
handle big machines and other stuff that would 
not fit through the doors of a high cube container.
A crane is required to place the machine through the
open top roof of the container into the container.
So this sort of container is more flexible and
not that tight as normal containers.

Also it is Open Source, so there must be the word 
Open somewhere :-)

The intention of the project is to have some sort 
of containerization that is more flexible and less
tight than existing solutions. 
Additionally a lean methodology will be used in order
to avoid complexity, well known as 'bloat'.

So there is nothing to see at the moment, but this 
will change in the future, so stay tuned.
